Machine Learning basics:
Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.
Recently, generative artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.
Machine Learning is defined as a technology that is used to train machines to perform various actions such as predictions, recommendations, estimations, etc., based on historical data or past experience.
Machine Learning enables computers to behave like human beings by training them with the help of past experience and predicted data.
